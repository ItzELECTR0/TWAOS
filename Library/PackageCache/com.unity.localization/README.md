# Localization

Use the Localization package to configure localization settings for your application.

Add support for multiple languages and regional variants, including:

- String localization: Set different strings to display based on locale. Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.
- Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.
- Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.
- Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.
