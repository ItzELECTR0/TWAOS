  "description": "Use the Localization package to easily configure localization settings for your application.\n\nAdd support for multiple languages and regional variants, including:\n\n• String localization: Set different strings to display based on locale. Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.\n• Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.\n• Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.\n• Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.",

    "changelog": "### Fixed\n\n- Exporting to an existing CSV file will now replace it instead of over-writing the contents. (LOC-1105). ([LOC-1105](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1105))\n- Fixed an issue when comparing locales in the player. We now do a check against the locale contents as well as the reference. ([LOC-1098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1096))\n- Fixed an issue where a table handle could become invalid and still be used. We now reload when this occurs. ([LOC-1098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1096))\n- Removed initialization during preloaded assets phase. This was causing freezing issues when trying to load bundles before any scenes had been loaded. ([ADDR-3664](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ADDR-3664))\n- Removed the ability to add a folder to an asset table. This is unsupported. ([LOC-1107](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1107))\n- Resolved issues with renaming entries when pulling data from a Google Sheet, particularly in cases where the ID between entries had been swapped. ([LOC-909](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-909))"
