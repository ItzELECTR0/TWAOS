| Term                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) | The [smallest cuboid containing the shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box) with edges parallel to the (Cartesian) coordinate axes. Computationally generated and typically used to check if two or more objects might be overlapping during the *broadphase*. |
| Center of mass (COM)             | Forces applied to the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass) push the body in the direction of the force without causing rotation.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Compound Collider                | A compound collider is a set of Physics Shapes nested under a single Physics Body. The shapes behave as a single body.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Convex Radius (Bevel Radius)     | To improve the performance and robustness of collision detection Unity Physics allows contacts to be generated within a small tolerance of the surface of a convex shape. This tolerance is referred to as convex radius or bevel radius.                                                                           |
| Convex shape                     | A convex shape or volume has the property that a line segment drawn between any two points inside the volume never leaves the volume. Unity Physics exploits this property to accelerate the performance of collision detection and spatial queries.                                                                |
| Degree of Freedom (DOF)          | A description of how a linear system is free to move. In rigid body dynamics this usually refers to the 6 degrees of freedom a body has when moving in free space. These are 3 linear and 3 angular degrees of freedom. They correspond to the axes you specify when describing a constraint.                       |
| Inertia Tensor                   | Describes the mass distribution of a rigid body. In particular it affects how the angular velocity of a body can change. See [Moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia).                                                                                                                  |
| Jacobian                         | Typically describes a constraint used during constraint solving. See [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant).                                                                                                                                                                     |
