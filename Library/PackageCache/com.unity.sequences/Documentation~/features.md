# Features & integrations

The Sequences package includes cinematics-dedicated features and integrates with other features of the Unity Editor. The following table lists the Unity Editor windows that you can use to perform specific tasks through these features.

| **Window** | **Tasks** |
|------------|--------------|
| [Sequences window](sequences-window.md) | • Create, organize and browse through the Sequences you’re working on.<br />• Load Scenes used in the context of specific Sequences.<br />• Record and export videos or other specific data from your Sequences. |
| [Sequence Assets window](sequence-assets-window.md) | • Create and edit Sequence Assets and Variants to further use them in your Sequences. |
| [Sequence Assembly window](sequence-assembly-window.md) | • Populate your Sequences with Sequence Assets.<br />• Swap and manage Sequence Asset Variants in context. |
| [Timeline window](timeline-window.md) | • Navigate through your Sequences and preview your assembled content in context.<br />• Edit, trim and reorder your Sequences.<br />• Manage the activation of Scenes used in specific Sequences. |
| [Hierarchy window](hierarchy-window.md) | • Populate your Sequences with creative content directly under the Sequence GameObjects. |

**Note:** Under the hood, the Sequences package features automatically create, organize
and adjust:
-   All underlying Unity elements necessary to support the overall Sequences functionality in the Unity Editor.
-   All necessary assets under a convenient folder structure.
-   All Timelines and nested Timeline tracks that allow you to edit your cinematic content.
