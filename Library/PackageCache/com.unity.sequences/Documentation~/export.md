# Export

## Recording a Sequence

You can access the Recorder window directly from a selected Sequence. The FPS rate and the Start-and-End frames of the Sequence are automatically applied to any Recorders created for it. A Recorder can export rendered video, an animation, audio, or a specific render pass.

>**Note:** The minimum version of the Recorder package supported by the Editor you're using is installed automatically when you install Sequences. For current and previous versions of Recorder documentation, see [Unity Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest/index.html).<br/>
Depending on the data type you need to export, you may need to install additional packages.

To record a Sequence:
1. Right-click on the targeted Sequence and select **Record**. The Recorder opens with the FPS rate and the Start-and-End frames set to the values that currently delimit the Sequence you selected.
2. On the Recorder window, [add and configure a Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest) You can add and configure additional Recorders according to the outputs you want.
3. Manually start the recording.
