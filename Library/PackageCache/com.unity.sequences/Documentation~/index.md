# Sequences package

>[!NOTE]
>To use the Sequences package, you must install it separately, in addition to the Unity Editor. For detailed information about package requirements and installation instructions, refer to [Installation](installation.md).

Use the Sequences package to efficiently create movies, game cinematics or any other linear content.

* Build and organize your project's editorial structure.
* Organize your creative content in categorized collections.
* Assemble self-contained, ready-to-use elements for easy authoring and collaboration.
* Try out new ideas in context in a non-destructive way.

Under the hood, the Sequences package features automate many Unity Editor processes to allow you to focus on your creative content without having to create and manage all necessary underlying Unity elements (Timelines, GameObject hierarchies, and project folders).
