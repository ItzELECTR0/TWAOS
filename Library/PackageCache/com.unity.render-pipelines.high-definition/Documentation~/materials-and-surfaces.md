# Materials and surfaces

Create and modify shader materials and Shader Graph materials in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).

|Page|Description|
|-|-|
|[Transparent and translucent materials](transparent-and-translucent-materials.md)|Enable and configure refractive materials in HDRP.|
|[Skin and diffusive surfaces (subsurface scattering)](skin-and-diffusive-surfaces-subsurface-scattering.md)|Use subsurface scattering to make organic materials, like skin, look smooth and natural rather than rough and plastic-like.|
|[Hair and fur](hair-and-fur.md)|Create hair and fur material.|
|[Eyes](eyes.md)|Use the Eye Prefab from HDRP's sample Eye scene to create eye material.|
|[Fabrics](fabrics.md)|Create fabric material such as cotton, wool, and silk.|
|[Decals](decals.md)|Use decals to decorate the surface of other materials, for example for effects like paint splatters and stickers.|
|[Fog Volume](create-a-fog-volume-shader.md)|Create a Fog Volume shader graph to control the shape and appearance of [local volumetric fog](create-a-local-fog-effect.md).|
|[Lit materials](lit-materials.md)|Create realistic materials that include options for effects like subsurface scattering, iridescence, vertex or pixel displacement, and decal compatibility.|
|[Unlit material](unlit-material.md)|Create materials that are not affected by lighting.|
|[Fullscreen material](fullscreen.md)|Create custom effects that appear over the entire screen view, for example to create custom post-process and custom pass effects.|
|[Canvas material](canvas-material.md)|Create Shader Graph shaders that can be applied to UGUI user interface elements.|
|[Customize shaders and materials](customize-shaders-and-materials.md)|Create HDRP-specific material types, expose material properties, and manage shaders and materials.|
|[Understand renderer and material priority](Renderer-And-Material-Priority.md)|Learn how to use a material's Priority property to change the order in which HDRP renders GameObjects.|
|[Modify materials at runtime](modify-materials-at-runtime.md)|Use shader keywords to enable and disable functionalities.|
|[Test and debug materials](test-and-debug-materials.md)|Use HDRP modes and tools to test your scene and assets in different lighting.|
