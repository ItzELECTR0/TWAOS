# Convert a project from the Built-in Render Pipeline

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) uses a new set of shaders and lighting units, both of which are incompatible with the [Built-in Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html). To upgrade a Unity Project to HDRP, you must first convert all your materials and shaders, then adjust individual light settings accordingly.
