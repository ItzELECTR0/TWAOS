# Recursive rendering override reference
For information on how recursive rendering works, refer to [Recursive rendering](Ray-Tracing-Recursive-Rendering.md).

| Property           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **State**          | Controls whether Recursive Rendering is enabled.             |
| **LayerMask**      | Defines the layers that HDRP processes this ray-traced effect for. |
| **Max Depth**      | Controls the maximum number of times a ray can reflect or refract before it stops and returns the final color. Increasing this value increases execution time exponentially. |
| **Max Ray Length** | Controls the length of the rays in meters that HDRP uses for ray tracing after the initial intersection. For the primary ray, HDRP uses the camera's near and far planes. |
| **Min Smoothness** | Defines the threshold at which reflection rays are not cast if the smoothness value of the target surface is inferior to the one defined by the parameter. |
| **Ray Miss**       | Determines what HDRP does when recursive rendering doesn't find an intersection. Choose from one of the following options: <br/>&#8226; **Reflection probes**: HDRP uses reflection probes in your scene to calculate the last recursive rendering bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Sky**: HDRP uses the sky defined by the current [Volume](understand-volumes.md) settings to calculate the last recursive rendering bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Both** : HDRP uses both reflection probes and the sky defined by the current [Volume](understand-volumes.md) settings to calculate the last recursive rendering bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Nothing**: HDRP does not calculate indirect lighting when recursive rendering doesn't find an intersection.<br/><br/>This property is set to **Both** by default. |
| **Last Bounce**    | Determines what HDRP does when recursive rendering lights the last bounce. Choose from one of the following options: <br/>&#8226; **Reflection probes**: HDRP uses reflection probes in your scene to calculate the last bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Sky**: HDRP uses the sky defined by the current [Volume](understand-volumes.md) settings to calculate the last recursive rendering bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Both**:  HDRP uses both reflection probes and the sky defined by the current [Volume](understand-volumes.md) settings to calculate the last recursive rendering bounce.<br/>&#8226; **Nothing**: HDRP does not calculate indirect lighting when it evaluates the last bounce.<br/><br/>This property is set to **Both** by default. |
