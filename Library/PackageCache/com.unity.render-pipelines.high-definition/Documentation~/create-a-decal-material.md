# Create a decal material

## Create a Decal shader material

New Materials in HDRP use the [Lit Shader](lit-material.md) by default. To create a Decal Material:

1. In the Unity Editor, navigate to your Project's Asset window.
2. Right-click the Asset Window and select **Create > Material**. This adds a new Material to your Unity Projectâ€™s Asset folder.
3. Click the **Shader** drop-down at the top of the Material Inspector, and select **HDRP > Decal**.

Refer to [Decal Material Inspector reference](decal-material-inspector-reference.md) for more information.

    3. In the **Material** drop-down, select **Decal**.
