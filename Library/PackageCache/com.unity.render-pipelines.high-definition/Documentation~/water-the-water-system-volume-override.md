# The Water System Volume Override

This override makes it possible to improve the performance of all water surfaces in the same global volume with adjustments to **Triangle Size**.

It also provides a dimmer to control the effect of the [Ambient Probe](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/ScriptReference/RenderSettings-ambientProbe.html) on water surfaces in the scene.

## Use and adjust the Override

See [Use the Water System in your Project](water-use-the-water-system-in-your-project.md) for information about how to enable the Volume Override. This is especially important when you upgrade your project from a version of Unity earlier than HDRP 14 (Unity 2022.2).

See [Settings and properties related to the Water System](settings-and-properties-related-to-the-water-system.md#watervoloverride) for more information about the Volume Override's properties.
