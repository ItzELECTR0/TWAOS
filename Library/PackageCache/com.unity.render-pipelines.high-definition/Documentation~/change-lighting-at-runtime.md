# Changing lighting at runtime

You can change how objects use the baked data in Adaptive Probe Volumes, to create lighting that changes at runtime. For example, you can turn the lights on and off in a scene, or change the time of day.

| [Choose how to change lighting at runtime](probevolumes-understand-changing-lighting-at-runtime.md) | Choose whether to use Lighting Scenarios or sky occlusion. |
| [Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios](probevolumes-bakedifferentlightingsetups.md) | Use multiple Lighting Scenarios to store baking results for different scene setups, and switch or blend between them at runtime. |
| [Update light from the sky at runtime with sky occlusion](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md) | Sky occlusion means that when a GameObject samples a color from the sky, Unity dims the color if the light can't reach the GameObject. |
