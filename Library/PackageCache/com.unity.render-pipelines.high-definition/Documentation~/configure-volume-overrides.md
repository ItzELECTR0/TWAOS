To add a Volume Override to a **Volume** component:

1. Select the GameObject with the **Volume** component.
2. In the Inspector window, select **Add Override**.
3. Select a Volume Override, or use the search field to search for one.

For example, to configure properties that relate to the [Motion Blur](Post-Processing-Motion-Blur.md), select **Add Override** then **Motion Blur**.

When you enable a property in a Volume Override, HDRP applies the property to the Volume Profile. The property also becomes editable.

You can also do the following:

- Select **All** to enable all properties.
- Select **None** to disable all properties.

Refer to [Volume component](volume-component.md) for more information.
