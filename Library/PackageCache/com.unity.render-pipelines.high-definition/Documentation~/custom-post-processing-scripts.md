## Custom post-processing example scripts

This example shows you how to create a **grayscale** effect. To get started:

1. Create a **C# Custom Post Process** file (right click in the Assets folder: **Create** > **Rendering** > **HDRP C# Post Process Volume**) and call it **GrayScale**. **Note**: Because of how serialization works in Unity, the file name and the class name must be identical or Unity doesn't serialize it correctly.
2. Copy the example code from the [GrayScale C# script section](#CSharp) into your **C# Post Process Volume**.
3. Create a full screen post-process Shader (right click in the Assets folder: **Create** > **Shader** > **HDRP** > **Post Process**) and call it **GrayScale**.
4. Copy the example code from the [GrayScale Shader script section](#Shader) into your post-process Shader.
5. Add the **GrayScale** effect to the list of custom post-processes that your Project executes. To do this, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **HDRP Default Settings** and, at the bottom of the **After Post Process** list, click on the **+**  and select **GrayScale**.
6. Now you can add the **GrayScale** post-process override to **Volumes** in the Scene. To change the effect settings, click the small **all** text just below the foldout arrow and adjust with the **Intensity** slider.
7. Optionally, you can create a custom editor for your post-processing effect. For information on how to do this, see [custom editor](#CustomEditor).

### GrayScale C# script

This is the C# custom post-process script. Custom post-process effects store configuration data and logic in the same class. To create the settings for the effect you can either use a pre-existing class that inherits from [`VolumeParameter<T>`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.VolumeParameter-1.html), or, if you want to use a property that the pre-existing classes don't include, create a new class that inherits from `VolumeParameter<T>`.

```C#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering;
using UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition;
using System;

[Serializable, VolumeComponentMenu("Post-processing/Custom/GrayScale")]
public sealed class GrayScale : CustomPostProcessVolumeComponent, IPostProcessComponent
{
    [Tooltip("Controls the intensity of the effect.")]
    public ClampedFloatParameter intensity = new ClampedFloatParameter(0f, 0f, 1f);

    Material m_Material;

    public bool IsActive() => m_Material != null && intensity.value > 0f;

    public override CustomPostProcessInjectionPoint injectionPoint => CustomPostProcessInjectionPoint.AfterPostProcess;

    public override void Setup()
    {
        if (Shader.Find("Hidden/Shader/GrayScale") != null)
            m_Material = new Material(Shader.Find("Hidden/Shader/GrayScale"));
    }

    public override void Render(CommandBuffer cmd, HDCamera camera, RTHandle source, RTHandle destination)
    {
        if (m_Material == null)
            return;

        m_Material.SetFloat("_Intensity", intensity.value);
        m_Material.SetTexture("_MainTex", source);
        HDUtils.DrawFullScreen(cmd, m_Material, destination);
    }

    public override void Cleanup() => CoreUtils.Destroy(m_Material);

}
```

This example code uses a `ClampedFloatParameter` that you can clamp to a range. In the constructor:

- The first parameter is the default value of the property.
- The second parameter represents the minimum value to clamp the property to.
- The third parameter represents the maximum value to clamp the property to.

HDRP calls the `IsActive()` function before the `Render` function to process the effect. If this function returns `false`, HDRP doesn't process the effect. It's good practice to check every property configuration where the effect either breaks or doesn'thing. In this example, `IsActive()` makes sure that HDRP can find the `GrayScale.shader` and that the intensity is greater than 0.

The **injectionPoint** override allows you to specify where in the pipeline HDRP executes the effect. Choose from the following injection points:

- **AfterOpaqueAndSky**
- **BeforeTAA**
- **BeforePostProcess**
- **AfterPostProcessBlurs.**
- **AfterPostProcess.**

To learn when in the render pipeline HDRP can execute custom post-processing passes, refer to [Execution order](rendering-execution-order.md).

**Note**: When you enable [Temporal antialiasing (TAA)](Anti-Aliasing.md#TAA), HDRP applies TAA between the injection points **BeforeTAA** and **beforePostProcess**. When you use [Depth Of Field](Post-Processing-Depth-of-Field.md) and enable its **Physically Based** property, HDRP performs a second TAA pass to perform temporal accumulation for this effect.

The `Setup`, `Render`, and `Cleanup` functions allocate, use, and release the resources that the effect needs. The only resource that the above script example uses is a single Material. This example creates the Material in `Setup` and, in `Cleanup`, uses `CoreUtils.Destroy()` to release the Material.

In the `Render` function, you have access to a [CommandBuffer](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Rendering.CommandBuffer.html) which you can use to enqueue tasks for HDRP to execute.
To draw a fullscreen quad, use the [HDUtils.DrawFullscreen](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition.HDUtils.html#UnityEngine_Rendering_HighDefinition_HDUtils_DrawFullScreen_UnityEngine_Rendering_CommandBuffer_UnityEngine_Material_UnityEngine_Rendering_RTHandle_UnityEngine_MaterialPropertyBlock_System_Int32_) method. This method works well with [RTHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.RTHandle.html) used to store the RenderTextures in HDRP, it mainly avoid rendering in a viewport bigger than actual view which can lead to scaling issues and performance problems.

**Note**: To sample a fullscreen texture in a shader rendered with [HDUtils.DrawFullscreen](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest?subfolder=/api/UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition.HDUtils.html#UnityEngine_Rendering_HighDefinition_HDUtils_DrawFullScreen_UnityEngine_Rendering_CommandBuffer_UnityEngine_Material_UnityEngine_Rendering_RTHandle_UnityEngine_MaterialPropertyBlock_System_Int32_), the UVs need to be scaled and clamped with the function `ClampAndScaleUVForBilinearPostProcessTexture`. This function also avoid having issue with scaling when dynamic resolution scaling is enabled.

### GrayScale Shader script

HDRP gives you total control over the vertex and fragment Shader so you can edit both of them to suit your needs.

There are several utility functions in [Common.hlsl](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/blob/master/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/Common.hlsl) and [Color.hlsl](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/blob/master/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary/Color.hlsl) that the Shader includes by default. This means that you have access to these utility functions in your effect. For example, the GrayScale Shader uses the `Luminance()` function to convert a linear RGB value to its luminance equivalent.

```glsl
Shader "Hidden/Shader/GrayScale"
{
    Properties
    {
        // This property is necessary to make the CommandBuffer.Blit bind the source texture to _MainTex
        _MainTex("Main Texture", 2DArray) = "grey" {}
    }

}
```

If none of your Scenes reference the Shader, Unity doesn't build the Shader and the effect doesn't work when you run your application outside of the Editor. To resolve this, do one of the following:

- Add the Shader to a [Resources folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LoadingResourcesatRuntime.html)
- Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Graphics** and add the Shader to the **Always Included Shaders** list.

**Note**: When HDRP executes your post-process effect, it uses a render target pooling system. It means that you don't know what the current color buffer contains, which is why you should never use any instructions that could display this color buffer. don't use transparency, blend modes, or the **clip()** instruction in your Shader, otherwise your effect breaks.

#### Shader inputs

By default, the Shader template provides you with the following inputs:

| Input        | description                                                  |
|:-------------| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| positionCS   | The clip space position of the pixel. This value is between 0 and the current screen size. |
| texcoord     | The full screen UV coordinate. This value is between 0 and 1. |
| _MainTex     | The source Texture. The GrayScale C# script passes this to the Shader. |
| _Intensity   | The intensity of the effect. The GrayScale C# script passes this to the Shader. |

## Custom editor

By default, Unity automatically creates an editor for classes but, if you want more control over how Unity displays certain properties, you can create a custom editor. If you do create a custom editor script, make sure to put it in a folder named **Editor**.

The following is an example of a custom editor for the GrayScale effect:

```C#
using UnityEditor.Rendering;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Rendering.HighDefinition;
using UnityEditor;

[CustomEditor(typeof(GrayScale))]
sealed class GrayScaleEditor : VolumeComponentEditor
{
    SerializedDataParameter m_Intensity;
    public override bool hasAdditionalProperties => false;

    public override void OnEnable()
    {
        base.OnEnable();
        var o = new PropertyFetcher<GrayScale>(serializedObject);
        m_Intensity = Unpack(o.Find(x => x.intensity));
    }
    public override void OnInspectorGUI()
    {
        PropertyField(m_Intensity);
    }
}
```

This custom editor isn't useful as it produces the same result as the editor that Unity creates. Custom Volume component editors also support an [additonal properties toggle](expose-all-additional-properties.md). To add it, you have to set the `hasAdvancedMode` override to true. Then, inside `OnInspectorGUI`, you can use the `isInAdvancedMode` Boolean to display more properties.
