### Lighting Scenarios

This section appears only if you enable **Lighting Scenarios** under **Light Probe Lighting** in the [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md).

| **Property** ||| **Description** |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Scenarios** ||| Lists the Lighting Scenarios in the Baking Set. To rename a Lighting Scenario, double-click its name. |
|| **Active** || Set the currently loaded Lighting Scenario, which HDRP writes to when you select **Generate Lighting**. |
|| **Status** || Indicates the status of the active Lighting Scenario. |
||| **Invalid Scenario** | A warning icon appears if the active Lighting Scenario is baked but HDRP can't load it anymore, for example if another Lighting Scenario has been baked that caused changes in the probe subdivision. |
||| **Not Baked** | An information icon appears if you haven't baked any lighting data for the active Lighting Scenario.|
||| **Not Loaded** | An information icon appears if scenes in the Baking Set aren't currently loaded in the Hierarchy window, so HDRP can't determine the Lighting Scenario status. |

## Sky Occlusion Settings

| **Property** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| **Sky Occlusion** | Enable [sky occlusion](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md). |
| **Samples** | Set the number of samples Unity uses to calculate the light each probe receives from the sky. Higher values increase the accuracy of the sky occlusion data, but increasing baking time. The default value is 2048. |
| **Bounces** | Set the number of times Unity bounces light from the sky off objects when calculating the sky occlusion data. Higher values increase the accuracy of the sky occlusion data, but increase baking time. Use higher values if objects block the direct view from probes to the sky. The default value is 2. |
| **Albedo Override** | Set the brightness of the single color Unity uses to represent objects the sky light bounces off, instead of the actual color of the objects. Higher values brighten the baked sky occlusion lighting. The default value is 0.6. |
| **Sky Direction** | Enable Unity storing and using more accurate data about the directions from probes towards the sky. Refer to [Enable more accurate sky direction data](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md#enable-more-accurate-sky-direction-data) for more information. |

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Search Radius</strong></td>
            <td>Determine how far from an invalid probe HDRP searches for valid neighbors. Higher values include more distant probes that might be in different lighting conditions than the invalid probe, resulting in unwanted behaviors such as light leaks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a name="dilationvaliditythreshold"></a><strong>Validity Threshold</strong></td>
            <td>Set the ratio of backfaces a probe samples before HDRP considers it invalid. Higher values mean HDRP is more likely to mark a probe invalid.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Dilation Iterations</strong></td>
            <td>Set the number of times Unity repeats the dilation calculation. This increases the spread of dilation effect, but increases the time HDRP needs to calculate probe lighting.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Squared Distance Weighting</strong></td>
            <td>Enable weighing the contribution of neighbouring probes by squared distance, rather than linear distance. Probes that are closer to invalid probes will contribute more to the lighting data.</td>

|-|-|
| **Scenario Size** | Indicates how much space on disk is used by the currently selected Lighting Scenario. |
| **Baking Set Size** | Indicates how much space on disk is used by all the baked Light Probe data for the currently selected Baking Set. This includes the data for all Lighting Scenarios, and the data shared by all Lighting Scenarios.
