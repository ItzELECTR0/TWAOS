The overall thickness of the refractive object between 0 and 1. The thicker the material, the more visible the effect is.<br />This property only appears when you set <strong>Refraction Model</strong> to either <strong>Box</strong> or <strong>Sphere</strong>. For the <strong>Thin</strong> model, HDRP implicitly sets this value to the equivalent of 5cm.
