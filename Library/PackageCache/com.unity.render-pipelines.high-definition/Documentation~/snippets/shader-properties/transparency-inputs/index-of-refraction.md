<td><strong>Index of Refraction</strong></td>
<td>

The index of refraction for this material. The index of refraction defines the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in the medium of the material. Higher values produce more intense refraction.<br />This property only appears when you select <strong>Box</strong>, <strong>Sphere</strong> or <strong>Thin</strong> from the <strong>Refraction Model</strong> drop-down.
