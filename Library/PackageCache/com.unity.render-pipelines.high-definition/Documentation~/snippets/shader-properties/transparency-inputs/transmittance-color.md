Specifies the color this material tints light which passes through it. You can assign a Texture to handle this colorization on a per pixel basis and/or use the color picker to set a global color. If you assign a Texture and set a color, the final color is a combination of the Texture you assign and the color you select.<br />This property only appears when you select <strong>Box</strong>, <strong>Sphere</strong>, or <strong>Thin</strong> from the <strong>Refraction Model</strong> drop-down.
