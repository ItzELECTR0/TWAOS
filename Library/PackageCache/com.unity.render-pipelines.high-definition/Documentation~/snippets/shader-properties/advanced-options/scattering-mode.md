<td><strong>Scattering Mode</strong></td>
<td>Indicates the light scattering method in a volume of hair. Requires the <strong>Physical</strong> Material Type and <strong>Strands</strong> Geometry Type to use:
<br/>&#8226; <strong>Approximate</strong>: Fall back to a simplified diffuse component to approximate hair color. This is generally acceptable for high-absorbent (dark) hair. This is the default for both Material types.
<br/>&#8226; <strong>Advanced</strong>: Simulate the scattering of light through a volume of hair strands. This is important for depicting low-absorbent (light) hair. Adds the <strong>Strand Probe Volume</strong> parameter.</td>
