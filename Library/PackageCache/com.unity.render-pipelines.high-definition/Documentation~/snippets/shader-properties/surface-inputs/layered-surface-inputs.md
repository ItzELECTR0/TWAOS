| <strong>Property</strong>                                 | <strong>Description</strong>                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <strong>Layer Count</strong>                              | Use the slider to set the number of layers this Material uses. You can set up to four layers. |
| <strong>Layer Mask</strong>                               | Assign a Texture to the field to manage the visibility of each layer. If you do not assign a Texture, the Material uses the maximum value for every channel.<br/>&#8226; Alpha channel for the <strong>Main Layer</strong>.<br/>&#8226; Red channel for <strong>Layer 1</strong>.<br/>&#8226; Green channel for <strong>Layer 2</strong>.<br/>&#8226; Blue channel for <strong>Layer</strong> |
| <strong>BlendMask UV Mapping</strong>                     | Use the drop-down to select the type of UV mapping that HDRP uses to map the <strong>Layer Mask</strong>.<br/>&#8226; Unity manages four UV channels for a vertex: <strong>UV0</strong>, <strong>UV1</strong>, <strong>UV2</strong>, and <strong>UV3</strong>.<br/>&#8226; <strong>Planar:</strong> A planar projection from top to bottom.<br/>&#8226; <strong>Triplanar</strong>: A planar projection in three directions:X-axis: Left to rightY-axis: Top to bottomZ-axis: Front to back Unity blends these three projections together to produce the final result. |
| <strong>World Scale</strong>                              | Set the world-space size of the Texture in meters. If you set this to <strong>1</strong>, then HDRP maps the Texture to 1 meter in world space.If you set this to <strong>2</strong>, then HDRP maps the Texture to 0.5 meters in world space.This property only appears when you select <strong>Planar</strong> or <strong>Triplanar</strong> from the <strong>BlendMask UV Mapping</strong> drop-down. |
| <strong>Tiling</strong>                                   | Set an <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> tile rate for the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> UV. HDRP uses the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> values to tile the Texture assigned to the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> across the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| <strong>Offset</strong>                                   | Set an <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> offset for the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> UV. HDRP uses the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> values to offset the Texture assigned to the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> from the Material’s surface, in object space. |
| <strong>Vertex Color Mode</strong>                        | Use the drop-down to select the method HDRP uses to combine the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> to manager layer visibility.<br/>&#8226; <strong>None</strong>: Only the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> affects visibility. HDRP does not combine it with vertex colors.<br/>&#8226; <strong>Multiply</strong>: Multiplies the vertex colors from a layer with the corresponding values from the channel in the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> that represents that layer. The default value for a pixel in the mask is 1. Multiplying the vertex colors of a layer by the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> reduces the intensity of that layer, unless the value in the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> is 1.<br/>&#8226; <strong>AddSubstract</strong>: Remaps vertex color values to between -1 and 1, and then adds them to the corresponding values from the channel in the <strong>Layer Mask</strong> that represents that layer. Vertex color values between 0 and 0.5 reduce the effect of that layer, values between 0.5 and 1 increase the effect of that layer. |
| <strong>Main Layer Influence</strong>                     | Enable the checkbox to allow the <strong>Main Layer</strong> to influence the albedo, normal, and height of <strong>Layer 1</strong>, <strong>Layer 2</strong>, and <strong>Layer 3</strong>. You can change the strength of the influence for each layer. |
| <strong>Use Height Based Blend</strong>                   | Enable the checkbox to blend the layers with a heightmap. HDRP then evaluates the height of each layer to check whether to display that layer or the layer above. |
| <strong>Height Transition</strong>                        | Use the slider to set the transition blend size between the Materials in each layer. |
| <strong>Lock Layers 123 Tiling With Object Scale</strong> | Enable the checkbox to multiply the Material's tiling rate by the scale of the GameObject. This keeps the appearance of the heightmap consistent when you scale the GameObject. |
