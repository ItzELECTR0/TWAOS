# Understand sky

You can create the following types of sky if your project use the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP):

- [Physically based sky](create-a-physically-based-sky.md)
- [High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) sky](create-an-hdri-sky.md), which is a simple sky that uses a cubemap texture.
- [Gradient sky](create-a-gradient-sky.md), which is a simple sky where HDRP interpolates between three colors.
- [Custom sky effects](create-a-custom-sky.md)

Use a [Visual Environment Volume Override](visual-environment-volume-override-reference.md) to change the type of sky HDRP uses, and configure the sky and clouds.
