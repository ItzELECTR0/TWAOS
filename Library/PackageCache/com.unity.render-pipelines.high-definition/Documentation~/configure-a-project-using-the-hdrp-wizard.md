# Configure a project using the HDRP Wizard

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) provides you with the [HDRP Wizard](Render-Pipeline-Wizard.md) to help you set up your Project with HDRP. You can also use it to add support for DirectX Raytracing (DXR) or VR to your HDRP Project. If you use the **High-Definition RP** Template to create your Project, you don't need to use the Render Pipeline Wizard, unless you want to use DXR or VR.

Refer to [HDRP Wizard](Render-Pipeline-Wizard.md) for more information.
