# Ray-traced effects
The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) uses ray tracing to replace some screen space effects, shadowing techniques, and Mesh rendering techniques.

| Page | Description |
|-|-|
|[Ray-Traced Ambient Occlusion](Ray-Traced-Ambient-Occlusion.md)|Use ray tracing data to generate ambient occlusion.|
|[Ray-Traced Contact Shadows](Ray-Traced-Contact-Shadows.md)|replaces [contact shadows](Override-Contact-Shadows.md) with a more accurate, ray-traced, contact shadow technique that can use off screen data.|
| [Ray-Traced Global Illumination](Ray-Traced-Global-Illumination.md) | Use ray tracing data to generate global illumination. |
|[Ray-Traced Reflections](Ray-Traced-Reflections.md)|Use ray tracing data to generate reflections.|
|[Ray-Traced Shadows](Ray-Traced-Shadows.md)|Use shadows generated from ray-traced directional, point, and area lights.|
|[Use the recursive rendering volume override](Ray-Tracing-Recursive-Rendering.md)|Trace a high number of rays that bounce multiple times.|
|[Ray-Traced Subsurface Scattering](Ray-Traced-Subsurface-Scattering.md) |Use ray tracing data to generate subsurface scattering.|
