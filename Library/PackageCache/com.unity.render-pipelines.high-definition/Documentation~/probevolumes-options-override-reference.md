# Adaptive Probe Volumes Options Override reference

To add an Adaptive Probe Volumes Options Override, do the following:

1. Add a [Volume](understand-volumes.md) to your Scene and make sure its area overlaps the position of the camera.
2. Select **Add Override**, then select **Lighting** > **Adaptive Probe Volumes Options**.

Refer to [Fix issues with Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-fixissues.md) for more information about using the Adaptive Probe Volumes Options Override.

| **Property**                           | **Description** |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Normal Bias**   | Enable to move the position used by shaded pixels when sampling Light Probes. The value is in meters. This affects how sampling is moved along the pixel's surface normal. |
| **View Bias**  | Enable to move the sampling position towards the camera when sampling Light Probes. The results of **View Bias** vary depending on the camera position. The value is in meters. |
| **Scale Bias with Min Probe Distance** | Scale the **Normal Bias** or **View Bias** so it's proportional to the spacing between Light Probes in a [brick](probevolumes-concept.md#how-probe-volumes-work). |
| **Sampling Noise** | Enable to increase or decrease the amount of noise HDRP adds to the position used by shaded pixels when sampling Light Probes. This can help [fix seams](probevolumes-fixissues.md#fix-seams) between bricks. |
| **Animate Sampling Noise** | Enable to animate sampling noise when Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA) is enabled. This can make noise patterns less visible. |
| **Leak Reduction Mode** | Enable to choose the method Unity uses to reduce leaks. Refer to [Fix light leaks](probevolumes-fixissues.md#fix-light-leaks).<br/>Options:<br/>&#8226; **None**: No leak reduction.<br/>&#8226; **Performance**: The uvw used to sample APV data are warped to try to have invalid probe not contributing to lighting. This samples APV a single time so it's a cheap option but will only work in the simplest cases.<br/>&#8226; **Validity and Normal Based**: This option samples APV between 1 and 3 times to provide the smoothest result without introducing artifacts. This is as expensive as Performance mode in the simplest cases, and is better and more expensive in the most complex cases. |
| **Occlusion Only Reflection Normalization** | Enable to limit Reflection Probe Normalization so it only decreases the intensity of reflections. Keep this enabled to reduce light leaks. Refer to [Frame Settings](frame-settings-reference.md#lighting). |
| **Intensity Multiplier** | Set the strength of the light contribution from Adaptive Probe Volumes. A value of 0 means Unity doesn't use the Adaptive Probe Volume data. |
| **Sky Occlusion Intensity Multiplier** | Set the strength of the light contribution from sky occlusion data in Adaptive Probe Volumes, if you enable [sky occlusion](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md). |
