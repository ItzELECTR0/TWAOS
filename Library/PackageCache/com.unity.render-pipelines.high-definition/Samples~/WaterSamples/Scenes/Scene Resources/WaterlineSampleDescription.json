	"""Welcome to the Water System Samples.
	The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/WaterSystem.html">Water System</a> allows you to add water to your scenes.

	This scene showcases the use of Before Post Process Custom Pass that allows you to further customize the water rendering, in this case blurring the hard waterline.
	
	<i>To make sure the project is set up properly, use the HDRP Asset Settings Helper buttons at the top of this component, otherwise some features might not be visible.</i>
	
<h1>Waterline</h1>
	
• The default Water line is a hard line separating over and under-water rendering. 
• This scene uses a <link="Waterline Custom Pass Post Process">Custom Pass</link> with a Full Screen Shader Graph injected Before Transparent. Water is a special kind of transparent so it still appears in the color buffer at that state.
• The Full Screen Shader Graph samples the underwater buffer by using the HD Sample Buffer node with 'isUnderwater' selected.
• The shader creates a blur effect around the line by sampling the HD Scene Color node.
• A small distortion is added by stretching the UVs above the water line to create a meniscus like effect.
• To prevent the effect from appearing when the camera is too far from the surface, the Camera Height From Water node is used. 


<h1>Drips and Droplets</h1>

• In addition to the waterline, the same <link="Waterline Custom Pass Post Process">Custom Pass</link> is also used to add some droplets to further distort the screen UV before sampling the HD Scene Color node.
• A double buffered <link="CustomRT.asset">Custom Render Texture</link> is sampled and offset at each frame to make the dripping effect. More information on the <link="CustomRT.shadergraph">Shader Graph</link>.
• Moreover, in this graph, the rotation of the camera is used to modulate the gravity parameter for dripping water. 
        
<h1>VFX</h1>
    
Multiple VFX are used in this scene: 
• For plants, a simple animation using vertex color from a mesh animates the branches separately with sin waves. <i>Open the <link="VFXG_FakeBoids_Fish.vfx">VFX Graph</link> for more information.</i>
• The school of fish is attracted by a sphere moving in the scene and constrained by box and sphere to stay underwater. <i>Open the <link="VFXG_Alga.vfx">VFX Graph</link> for more information.</i>
• The bubbles use the Sample Water Surface node in the VFX graph to prevent the bubble to appear above the water surface. <i>Open the <link="VFX_BubblesStream.vfx">VFX Graph</link> for more information.</i>
• Lastly, there are lots of floating particles in the water to simulate dirtiness. <i>Open the <link="VFXG_Grain.vfx">VFX Graph</link> for more information.</i>

<h1>Volumetric Fog</h1>
        
• To make underwater rendering more realistic, Volumetric Fog has been added with an anisotropy of 0.5
• When enabled, Volumetric fog uses automatically the caustics texture from the water surface to generate rays penetrating from the surface.""",
