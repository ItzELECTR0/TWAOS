	The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Local-Volumetric-Fog.html">Local Volumetric Fog</a> component allows the usage of <b>3D Textures</b> or <b>Shader Graphs</b> to add details and animation locally to the fog. <b>Blending Modes</b> are also available to add, multiply or overwrite fog values.
	
	The Local Fog visual quality is dependent on the <b>Volumetric Fog quality settings</b>, found in the active <b>Volume Profile</b>. The Manual control offers precise management over the Fog’s budget : for an effect with lots of variation over a short distance, it is preferred to increase the <b>Volume Slice Count</b>. If performance is an issue, the <b>Screen Resolution Percentage</b> can be kept low as a tradeoff.""",

	The <b>Overwrite</b> blending mode will replace any fog value. It won’t blend at all with the surrounding fog, noticeably on the blend distance. Can be useful to remove fog from an interior.
	
	The <b>Multiply</b> blending mode can be used to remove fog density locally, by multiplying the color and density with a small value. Can be useful to seamlessly remove fog locally.
