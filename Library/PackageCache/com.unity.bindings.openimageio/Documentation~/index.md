# OpenImageIO Bindings package

The OpenImageIO Bindings package provides access to a subset of the OpenImageIO C++ library scripts.

>[!NOTE]
>The OpenImageIO Bindings package exposes only a subset of the full API. That subset enables IO operations for image files, as used in the Recorder package. Unity does not recommend to use the OpenImageIO Bindings package for image file manipulation.
