    "changelog": "### Added\n- Additional tests for UI Input default actions (Navigate, Submit, Scroll etc.)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where UI interactions would not function without setting up a project-wide actions asset in Project Settings. Default UI actions are now created on the fly, if no asset for project-wide actions has been set. [ISXB-811](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-811).\n- Physical keyboards used on Android/ChromeOS could have keys \"stuck\" reporting as pressed after a long press and release [ISXB-475](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-475).\n- NullReferenceException thrown when right-clicking an empty Action Map list in Input Actions Editor windows [ISXB-833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-833).\n- Fixed an issue where `System.ObjectDisposedException` would be thrown when deleting the last ActionMap item in the Input Actions Asset editor.\n- Fixed DualSense Edge's vibration and light bar not working on Windows\n- Fixed Project-wide Actions asset failing to reload properly after deleting project's Library folder.\n- Fixed an issue where `System.InvalidOperationException` is thrown when entering PlayMode after deleting an ActionMap from Project-wide actions and later resetting it.\n- Fixed Input Actions Editor window resource leak that could result in unexpected exceptions [ISXB-865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-865).\n- Fixed an issue where UI integration would throw exceptions when Project-wide Input Actions asset did not contain the implicitly required `UI` action map or was missing any of the required actions. Additionally this fix now also generates warnings in the console for any divergence from expected action configuration or lack of bindings in edit-mode.\n\n### Changed\n- For Unity 6.0 and above, when an `EventSystem` GameObject is created in the Editor it will have the\n`InputSystemUIInputModule` by default if the Input System package is installed and enabled."
