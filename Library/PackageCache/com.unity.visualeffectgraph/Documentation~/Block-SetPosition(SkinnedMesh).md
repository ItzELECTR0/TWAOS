# Set Position (Skinned Mesh)

Menu Path: **Position > Set Position (Skinned Mesh)**

Use the **Set Position (Skinned Mesh)** Block to set particle positions based on the shape of a Skinned Mesh Renderer component.

The Block calculates positions from the vertex data of the mesh, and stores the results in the [position attributes](Reference-Attributes.md).

Note: [Velocity from Direction and Speed](Block-VelocityFromDirection&Speed(NewDirection).md) Blocks can then process the direction attribute.
