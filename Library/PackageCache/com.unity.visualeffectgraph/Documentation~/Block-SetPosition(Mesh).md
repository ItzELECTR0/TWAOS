# Set Position (Mesh)

Menu Path: **Position > Set Position (Mesh)**

Use the **Set Position (Mesh)** Block to set particle positions based on the shape of a mesh.

The Block calculates positions from the vertex data of the mesh, then stores the results in the [position attributes](Reference-Attributes.md).

Note: [Velocity from Direction and Speed](Block-VelocityFromDirection&Speed(NewDirection).md) Blocks can then process the direction attribute.
