# Entities Graphics

Entities Graphics provides systems and components for rendering [ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest) entities. Entities Graphics is not a render pipeline: it is a system that collects the data necessary for rendering ECS entities, and sends this data to Unity's existing rendering architecture.
