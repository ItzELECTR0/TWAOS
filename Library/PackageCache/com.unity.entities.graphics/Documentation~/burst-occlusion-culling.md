# Burst Occlusion Culling

Burst Occlusion Culling is a Burst-optimized occlusion culling system available in the Entities Graphics package. It provides a cross-platform occlusion system that disables the rendering of objects when they're occluded by other objects, and hence are not seen by the camera.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version of Burst Occlusion Culling is experimental. This means that it isn't yet ready to use for production and parts of the implementation and API will change.
