# Requirements and compatibility

This page contains information on system requirements and compatibility of the Entities Graphics package.

## Render pipeline compatibility

Entities Graphics requires a Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) to function.

| **Render pipeline**                        | **Compatibility**    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Built-in Render Pipeline**               | Not supported        |
| **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** | Unity 2022 LTS       |
| **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**        | Unity 2022 LTS       |

For **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, only Forward+ rendering path is supported.

For more information about the supported feature set, see [Entities Graphics feature matrix](entities-graphics-versions.md).

## Unity Player system requirements

This section describes the Entities Graphics packageâ€™s target platform requirements. For platforms or use cases not covered in this section, general system requirements for the Unity Player apply.

For more information, see [System requirements for Unity](xref:system-requirements).

| **Platform**                           | **HDRP**          | **URP**                          |

> [!NOTE]
> Entities Graphics also depends on platform support of Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP). See system requirements for [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest?subfolder=/manual/requirements.html) and [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest?subfolder=/manual/System-Requirements.html).

## ECS feature compatibility

Entities Graphics does not support multiple [Worlds](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest?subfolder=/manual/concepts-worlds.html). Limited support for multiple Worlds is intended in a later version. The current plan is to add support for creating multiple rendering systems, one per renderable World, but then only have one World active for rendering at once.
