# Entities Graphics

![](images/HybridRendererSplash.png)

Entities Graphics provides systems and components for rendering [ECS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest) entities. Entities Graphics is not a render pipeline: it is a system that collects the data necessary for rendering ECS entities, and sends this data to Unity's existing rendering architecture.

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) are responsible for authoring the content and defining the rendering passes.

## Requirements

For information about Entities Graphics's requirements, see [Requirements and compatibility](requirements-and-compatibility.md).

## Getting started with Entities Graphics
