# Sample projects

To explore more use cases of the Entities Graphics, the **EntityComponentSystemSamples** repository contains various samples.

This repository is hosted [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) on Unity Technology's GitHub.

When you clone the Project's repository, make sure to use git or a git client. This is because if you use the Green button on the GitHub website, it does not download all the Assets.

The Entities Graphics sample projects can be found at:

- **HDRP**: [HDRPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/GraphicsSamples/HDRPSamples)
- **URP**: [URPSamples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/GraphicsSamples/URPSamples)

Sample projects use Entities Graphics and require Unity 2022 LTS or later.
