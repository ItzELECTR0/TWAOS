# The BatchRendererGroup API

Entities Graphics is built on top of the Unity Engine [BatchRendererGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.BatchRendererGroup.html) API. This API connects Entities Graphics to the Unity Engine rendering backend. If you use Entities Graphics, you don't need to interact with this API directly.

Unity updated the `BatchRendererGroup` API in Unity 2022.1 and replaced the old code paths with a single unified code path. The new API is easier to use, more efficient, more flexible, and has full test coverage. 

For more information about the new BatchRendererGroup API, see the [BatchRendererGroup](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.BatchRendererGroup.html) documentation.
