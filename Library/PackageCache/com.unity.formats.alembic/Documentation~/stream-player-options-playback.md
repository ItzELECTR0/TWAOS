| __Time__  | Set the time in seconds of the animation that is currently displayed on the screen. This property operates like a playhead control, as you can scrub or animate it to play the animation. Valid values are from 0 to the length of the animation. |
| __Vertex Motion Scale__ | Set the magnification factor when calculating velocity. Greater velocity means more blurring when used with Motion Blur. By default, the value is set to 1 (the velocity is not scaled).<br />**Note:** This setting only applies to computed velocity values. It has no effect on velocity property values read from the Alembic asset source. |
| __Time Range__ | Select the time range that corresponds to the portion of the animation you want to be able to play back in Unity. By default, this includes the entire animation.<br />To change the time range, either drag the handles or directly enter the start and end values in seconds. |
