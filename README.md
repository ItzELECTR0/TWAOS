Official support is not available to you. If you use the contents of this repository for anything other than building it yourself or examining the code, you are on your own. For any modifications, you will have to rely on yourself or the community for help. We hope this is an understandable request since this is a paid product offered for free officially. This repository will be maintained until the development of the game is complete. This is both an offering to the community and our cloud backup of the game.

Don't pirate. Don't buy stolen keys. Build it yourself. It's still free, and it's better than piracy.

# The Story
It all begins in 2066. You take the role of Sip. His story starts like any other, with Sip starting out at a new school. But Sip is different from the rest. Way different. Sip is a child with special powers in a world that will punish anyone like him.

Sip lives with his poor family in a cabin in the woods. His dream is to become a famous singer and make enough money for his family. But just when everything is going well for him, a horrible tragedy strikes. Sip and his brother Zip are forced to run away. Your job is to guide Sip on this adventure full of crazy events and help him achieve his destiny. But be careful not to be the cause of his downfall.

# The Gameplay
The player is set in a 3D world controlled with a third-person camera. The environment is closed down and partially interactable. You will unlock the use of Sip's supernatural lightning powers and be able to use them at will to either be the hero or become the very thing you swore to destroy. The game will make you experience Sip's life from that point forward, and it is up to you to guide him.

# Mature Content
The game contains battles, constant profanity, and some gore that can be disabled. Some aspects may be classified as light psychological horror.
