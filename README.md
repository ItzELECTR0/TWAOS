# THE STORY

It all begins In 2066. You take the role of Sip.
His story starts like any other, Sip starting out at a new school.
But Sip is different from the rest. Way different.
Sip is a child with special powers in a world which will punish anyone like him.
Sip lives with his poor family in a cabin in the woods.
Sip's dream is to become a famous singer and make enough money for his family.
But right when everything was going well for him, a horrible tragedy strikes.
And so Sip along with his brother Zip are forced to run away.
Your job is to guide Sip on this adventure full of crazy events and help him achieve his destiny.
But be careful not to be the cause of his downfall.

# THE GAMEPLAY

The player is set in a 3D world controlled with a 3rd person camera.
The environment is closed down and partially interactable.
You shall unlock the use of Sip's supernatural lightning powers.
And will be able to use them at free will to either be the hero, or become the very thing you swore to destroy.
The game will make you experience Sip's life from that point forward and it is up to you to guide him.
