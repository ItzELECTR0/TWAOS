## RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMER

Official support is not available to you. If you use the contents of this repository for anything other than building it yourself or examining the code, you are on your own. For any modifications, you will have to rely on yourself or the community for help. I hope this is an understandable request since this is a paid product offered for free officially. This repository will be maintained until the development of the game is complete. This is both an offering to the community and my cloud backup of the game.

I want to make it clear that while the first chapter is free, the rest won't be.
Don't pirate. Don't buy stolen keys. Build it yourself. It's still free, and it's better than piracy.

##  THE PREMISE

The characters of the game are spheres. The world they live in is one of powers. The game's main story takes place in 2069 (Starts in 2066). The main character, Sip, has the power of lightning and energy, but not the regular one, it's quite, different.

## THE STORY

Welcome to <b>2066</b>, where every individual is born with a unique <b>power</b>.
You take on the role of <b>Sip</b> Dorian, a boy who appears to be cursed with the weakest of all abilities: <b>lightning</b>.
A gift from the <b>Electrinity</b>, a deity who praises itself for what it created in Sip.
Sip's life begins in a small, isolated cabin in a forest, at a time he didn't know what was being asked of him by the Electrinity.
After what it told him, he just wanted a peaceful existence. But it refused.
Guided by the <b>mystery</b> of his mind, Sip tries to avoid confrontation, and unnecessary attention, but that doesn't last long.
And he is forced to face the dark truths about his world and himself.
Will he rise to become the hero the world needs? Will he finally <b>feel</b> the way he wants to? Or will he remain the <b>same</b>. Forever.

## THE GAMEPLAY

Immerse yourself in a richly detailed 3D world from a third-person perspective, where every choice shapes Sip's destiny.
Explore closed environments filled with interactive elements and hidden secrets.
Unlock and master Sip's supernatural lightning powers, capable of manipulating any form of energy.
Engage in combat and explore, using Sip's abilities to either protect the innocent or unleash havoc.
Your decisions will determine whether Sip becomes a beacon of hope or a force of destruction.
Experience a gripping narrative that blends heart-wrenching drama with psychological horror.
As Sip's enigmatic mind and mysterious smile unveil the true extent of his power.

I wish to finish the first one by 2027, the rest following along not too long after
