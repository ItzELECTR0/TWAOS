## RESPONSIBILITY DISCLAIMER

Official support is not available to you. If you use the contents of this repository for anything other than building it yourself or examining the code, you are on your own. For any modifications, you will have to rely on yourself or the community for help. I hope this is an understandable request since this is a paid product offered for free officially. This repository will be maintained until the development of the game is complete. This is both an offering to the community and my cloud backup of the game.

I want to make it clear that while the first chapter is free, the rest won't be.
Don't pirate. Don't buy stolen keys. Build it yourself. It's still free, and it's better than piracy.

##  THE PREMISE

The characters of the game are spheres. The world they live in is one of powers. The game's main story takes place in 2069 (Starts in 2066). The main character, Sip, has the power of lightning and energy, but not the regular one, it's quite, different.

## THE STORY

Short placeholder explination: Sip is one rejected by the world and his family, with what is considered the weakest power of all. He partakes in the biggest tragedy of his life and is forced to run away.
The story is undergoing major rewriting. Consider the Steam and Itch.io descriptions invalid for now. 

## THE GAMEPLAY

The player is set in a 3D world controlled with a third-person camera. The environment is closed down and partially interactable. You will unlock the use of Sip's supernatural lightning powers and be able to use them at will to either be the hero or become the very thing you swore to destroy. The game will make you experience Sip's life from that point forward, and it is up to you to guide him.

## DEVELOPMENT PLANS

The game is planned to have 10 chapters.
I wish to finish the first one by 2027, the rest following along not too long after

## MATURE CONTENT

The game contains battles, constant profanity, and some gore that can be disabled.
Some aspects may be classified as light psychological horror.
