# Billboard shadows may flicker in builds
Using Unity 2022.x textures may not be properly bound during the shadow caster passes when it comes to the billboards.
This only occurs in builds (testen on Windows 11 using DX11 and Vulkan)!

-> The only solution i have found so far: Duplicate the billboard shader multiple times and assign the different shaders to the different billboards (small, medium, bare, large).

-> This is fixed at least in Unity 2022.3.20f1
