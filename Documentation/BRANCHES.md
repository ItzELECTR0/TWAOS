# Branches and their Meaning

</div>

<div align="left">

## MAIN
### The main branch of the project, as the name suggests.
What is pushed to this branch (As of the creation of this document and the other branches) will be production only.
<br> Meaning the code has been tested and assured as functional beforehand.

#### Current status of main: Unstable (Builds can successfully be completed)

## TESTING
### The experimental branch, as the name implies.
What will be pushed to this (As of the creation of this document and the other branches) is fully experimental and in testing.
<br> Meaning it will ALWAYS be 'cutting edge' and NEVER production ready.
<br> Use it at your own risk.

#### Current status of Testing: Extremely Unstable (Builds can be completed)

## UPDATE
### A branch for updating the project to future Unity versions
I like to keep my project up to date, however sometimes Unity launches some updates that just break everything.
<br> So instead of pushing all the broken code to 'main' or 'Testing' it will be pushed here until ready to ensure a successful update.
<br> Meaning this branch is not fully 'cutting edge' but not fully 'production ready' either.
<br> Use it at your own risk.

#### Current status of Update: Updated to Unity 6 Preview 14 Successfuly.
