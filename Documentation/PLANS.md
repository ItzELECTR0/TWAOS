## DEVELOPMENT PLANS
### An In-Depth Analysis

</div>

<div align="left">

### The Story
The story will a reflection of the state of mind
<br> It will be split and written across 10 chapters, each written individually.
<br> There are ideas for multiple expansions, but those cannot be talked about yet.
<br> Not much more details can be revealed about the story iteself or the writing process.

### The Process
Development happens at the speed of which I can manage to gather the resources necessary to build it.
<br> That includes both money and assets.
<br> My current process is a mess, and it would be best to not explain it,
<br> However, in a nutshell, I get back into it on random burts, when my mind gets tired of beating me down.
<br> I try my best to get some daily progress in, even if I don't push it to git.
<br> My plannings are to imrove both my schedule and development environment,
<br> Because these play a big part in why progress is the way it is right now.

### The Co-Op
This is something I want to set straight, but also something I cannot go very in-depth with.
<br> The Co-Op will not be an initial part of the game's release,
<br> It will come after all 10 chapters have released as a standalone expansion, alongside a specific other expansion for the game.
<br> The Co-Op will feature separate perspectives for the 3 main characters and the way they see the story
<br> The Co-Op expasion will also bring a new story mode to the single player, the ability to play from a perspective other than Sip's.
<br> With that said, it's the very limit of what I can say without revealing too much.

### The Networking
The project is intended to functian via Steam networking. Therefore requirig Steam DRM.
<br> However, for the FOSS version of the game I **MIGHT** implement an alternative networking method.
<br> I do want as many people to enjoy the game together when I finally get around to adding the Co-Op, but,
<br> If it's too much of a hassle for me to implement two methods of networking, I will not do it.
<br> If that's what I end up doing, I will be throwing around steam keys sometimes, so watch your heads.

### The Expansions
This is something I have to be vague about, since I have a tendency to overshare.
<br>However, I find it fine to mention this much.
<br>Aside from the multiplayer expansion, the game is planned to have 3 other DLCs.
<br>After those are complete and released, this reposity will stop being maintained by me,
<br>As well as conclude the development of this game, and I will move on to other projects.

### The Music
I am not very good at composing, and artists are very expensive, especially when it comes to OSTs
<br> While the game may end up having some OSTs either composed by me or people I hire,
<br> Most of the music will be licensed from existing works, rather than creating ones from scratch.
<br> There are also plans to license copyrighted audio, music and songs,
<br> But I want to settle agreements that allow content creators to play the copyrighted material on video
<br> Without losing their monetization or rights to their video.
