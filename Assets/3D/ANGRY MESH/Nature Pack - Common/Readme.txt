We have in plan to launch more Nature assets in the future. We created the "Nature Pack - Common" folder to keep all common files in one place. This allows you to reuse scripts, shaders and functions in all packages from the Nature Pack.

How to use AG Global system:
1) Drag and drop the AG Global in your scene.
2) Play with the settings.

AG Global Snow (Limited) is a limited version that offers only some of the features available in AG Global Settings.
- Use AG Global Limited if you own only the PBR Rocks package.
- Use AG Global Settings if you have any other Nature packages, such as Winter Environment.

IMPORTANT:
- You must keep one of the AG Global Settings or AG Global Snow (Limited) prefabs in each scene.
- Use only one AG Global prefab in your scene. Multiple AG Global prefabs are not supported.
- AG Global system works only with Nature Packs by ANGRY MESH.
