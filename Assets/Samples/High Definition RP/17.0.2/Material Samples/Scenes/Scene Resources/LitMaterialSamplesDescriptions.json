The Lit Shader is HDRP's general purpose shader. It is designed and optimized to represent most of the materials needed in real time production.
     
The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Material-Type.html">HDRP Lit Material Types</a> are : Standard, Subsurface Scattering, Anisotropy, Translucent, Iridescence and Specular color. 

This scene doesn't contain examples of the Specular color mode as it is intended for texturing workflow compatibility more than achieving a specific effect.""",

The Detail Map is a texture that combines Albedo variation (Red channel), Normal (Green and Alpha channels) and Smoothness variation (Blue channel) information. The detail map should repeat seamlessly so it can be tiled several times to add small details to a material. In comparison, the Base Color, Mask Map and Normal Map are used to represent unique details.

Used alone, the Detail map can represent pretty well materials that don't need hue variation in the Base Color or in Metallic value. 

Detail maps can also be used with the Layered Lit shader when blending several material is necessary.Detail maps can easily be shared across different materials and building a library of detail maps is very useful to add details to generic materials such as plaster, plastic, metal, rubber, concrete ...
